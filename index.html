      <h2 class="fontD">Why Do We Sleep?</h2>
      <p class="fontD">Sleep is a period of rest for both your brain and your body, serving two main functions: protein
        synthesis
        throughout the body and maintaining neural plasticity in the brain. This allows for your body to recover and
        your
        mind to consolidate new memories from the day before with old material.</p>

      <h2 class="fontD">What Happens When We Sleep?</h2>
      <p class="fontD">Sleep cycles through a succession of different states of consciousness, which are recorded
        through
        electroencephalograms (EEGs).</p>
      <p class="fontD">When you are awake, your brain functions on alpha and beta waves depending on alertness.</p>
      <h3 class="fontD"><em>Stage 1</em></h3>
      <p class="fontD">As you fall asleep, you become relaxed, enter the hypnagogic state, and do not respond to
        external stimuli.
        This
        begins Non-REM-1 (NREM 1), which consist of theta brain waves. During short naps, your brain usually enters this
        state of consciousness and is woken up around this state because it is the lightest form of sleep.</p>
      <h3 class="fontD"><em>Stage 2</em></h3>
      <p class="fontD">Passing into NREM-2, your brain exhibits high-frequency bursts of activity, known as sleep
        spindles. </p>
      <h3 class="fontD"><em>Stage 3</em></h3>
      <p class="fontD">When you enter deeper sleep in NREM-3, the EEGs show mostly delta waves as your heart rate,
        respiration,
        temperature, and blood flow are reduced. This is also when your body begins repairing itself with growth hormone
        involved in maintaining physiological functions.</p>
      <h3><em>Stage REM><em>Stage REM</em></h3>
      <p class="fontD">After reaching stage 3, you cycle back up through to stage 1 and into Rapid Eye Movement (REM)
        sleep after 90
        minutes. This is usually when you begin dreaming. Your eyes move rapidly, your breathing becomes shallow and
        irregularly rapid, your heart rate and blood pressure increases, and your muscles become paralyzed, mirror in
        your
        dreaming pattern while preventing sleep walking.</p>

      <h2 class="fontD">What Happens When We Don't Sleep?</h2>
      <p>Because sleep>Because sleep is a complex process and performs such a crucial function, sleep deprivation can
        result in
        drowsiness, inability to concentrate, memory impairment, and immune system detoriation.</p>

      <h2 class="fontD">Why SleepSchedule?</h2>
      <p class="fontD">The title is quite self-explanatory. Using circadian rhythms, the app calculates the times at
        which you need
        to sleep and helps you fall asleep with a variety of playlists featuring white noise, audio storybooks, and
        classical music.</p>
      <p class="fontD">With today's business schedules and the virtual environment, students and people in the workforce
        struggle to
        balance work and sleep as there are no clear boundaries between your desk and your bed. Furthermore, excessive
        use of technological devices, which emit blue light, increase difficulty of falling asleep. Our app aims to
        solve that problem by providing the resources</p>
